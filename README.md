## Railway Electrification and Freight Movement Analysis

### Electrification Levels Analysis
- **Objective:** Conducted a comprehensive analysis of railway electrification levels across various zones and years.
- **Methods Applied:** Normality tests, Kruskal-Wallis tests, Bonferroni post-hoc tests.
- **Key Findings:** Identified substantial variations in electrification levels among zones, with the METRO zone exhibiting significantly higher electrification levels compared to others.

### Mode of Transport Analysis
- **Objective:** Analyzed the differences in freight movement between passenger and freight trains.
- **Methods Applied:** Normality tests, Mann-Whitney U test.
- **Key Findings:** Revealed a significant disparity in freight movement between passenger and freight trains.

### Railway Route Infrastructure Forecast
- **Objective:** Forecasted the total route kilometers up to 2030, distinguishing between electrified and non-electrified routes.
- **Methods Applied:** Regression analysis, Exponential Smoothing model.
- **Key Findings:** Predicted an increase in total route kilometers to 71,245.01 km by 2030.

### Freight Movement Forecast
- **Objective:** Forecasted freight movement across rail, road, and air transport up to 2030.
- **Methods Applied:** Exponential Smoothing, ARIMA models.
- **Projections:**
  - **Rail Freight:** Expected to rise from 312,371 to 1,924,160 million ton-kilometres.
  - **Road Freight:** Expected to escalate from 494,000 to 7,202,941.2 million ton-kilometres.
  - **Air Freight:** Expected to increase from 547.65 to 891.24 million ton-kilometres.
